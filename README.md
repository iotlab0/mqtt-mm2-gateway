# Snips-MM2-Bridge
This is an extension for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).  It provides provides a interface to connect the offline voice recognition snips with the Magic Mirror Software and is therefor required for all my other modules that make use of snips.
To work this module requires the offline Voice Recognition Snips. A explanation on how to install Snips and the App is included in the installation Guide.

## Supported Modules
1.  [MMM-SnipsHideShow](https://gitlab.com/CaptnsTech/mmm-snipshideshow)

More modules will follow soon. If you want your module to be supported just open a gitlab issue

## Installation
1.  Ensure that you have the necessary libraries/clients for mqtt installed on the computer that will be running this extension.  (For example, running `sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients` on Debian-based distributions.)
2.  Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://gitlab.com/CaptnsTech/snips-mm2-bridge.git`. A new folder will azppear, likely called `snips-mm2-bridge`.  Navigate into it.
3.  Execute `npm install` to install the node dependencies.
4.  The installation of Snips can be done according to this [explanation](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation).

## Using the module
To use this module, add this to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
	{
		module: 'snips-mm2-bridge',
		config: {
			// See 'Configuration options' for more information.
		}
	}
]
````

## Configuration options
The following options can be configured:

| Option  | Description  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mqttServer`  | Connection string for the server to connect to (e.g. `mqtt://localhost`) **See:** Server IP  |

## Server IP
IP adress the mqtt server snips is connected to is running on. `mqtt://localhost` when snips is running on the same device (and you do use the MQTT Broker coming with snips)

## Dependencies
  -  [mqtt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) (installed via `npm install`)

## Contributing Guidelines
Contributions of all kinds are welcome, not only in the form of code but also with regards bug reports and documentation.

Please keep the following in mind:

  -  **Bug Reports**:  Make sure you're running the latest version. If the issue(s) still persist: please open a clearly documented [issue](https://gitlab.com/CaptnsTech/snips-mm2-bridge/issues) with a clear title.
  -  **Minor Bug Fixes**: Please send a pull request with a clear explanation of the issue or a link to the issue it solves.
  -  **Major Bug Fixes**: please discuss your approach in an GitLab [issue](https://gitlab.com/CaptnsTech/snips-mm2-bridge/issues) before you start to alter a big part of the code.
  -  **New Features**: please discuss in a GitLab [issue](https://gitlab.com/CaptnsTech/snips-mm2-bridge/issues) before you start to alter a big part of the code. Without discussion upfront, the pull request will not be accepted / merged.

## Planned
1.  password/username and tls support for mqtt
2.  custom topics so the module works as a interface between any MQTT broker and any MM2 module
